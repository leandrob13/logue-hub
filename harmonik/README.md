# Harmonik

The Harmonik is an additive oscillator comprised of 6 sine wave oscillators, each of them has an amplitude control and are summed to get the final tones.
By default, each voice is spread apart by the harmonic series with the root note as the fundamental frequency. The Spread setting can change this so that we get even, odd or octave partials in the mix. 
For more harmonic addition, a wave folder can be controlled with the Shape knob.   

## Features

- Six sine wave oscillators with amplitude control.
- A wave folder that folds each sine wave before summing the result to the final signal.
- Spread control for the partials so that we have harmonic, odd or even partial overtones.
- Offset control for asymetric wavefolding.
- The wave folder can be modulated with the Shape LFO.
